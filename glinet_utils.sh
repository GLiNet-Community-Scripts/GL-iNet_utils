# ── Versioning (bump the line above before every push to GitHub) ─────────────
# The self-updater compares this value as a plain string (test's \> operator),
# so incrementing it is exactly what tells installed copies a newer release
# exists. Forget to bump it and nobody gets the update.
# Format: YYYY-MM-DD  (e.g. 2026-07-04). For multiple releases on the same day as
# the previous version, append _HH:MM in 24-hour time (e.g. 2026-07-04_14:30)
# so each still sorts as newer. It MUST stay lexically sortable — a later
# date/time has to string-compare greater than an earlier one.

# UI / UX STANDARDS  (read before changing any prompt, menu, or message)
# =============================================================================
# Governance principle
# --------------------
# Clarity first, concision second. Every prompt and selectable label names the
# specific thing it acts on ("Delete this backup?" not "Confirm"). Use plain,
# conversational language and the fewest words that keep the action
# unambiguous - cut filler, never cut comprehension. Generic verbs ("OK", bare
# "Confirm", "Submit") and cryptic abbreviations are prohibited, as is padding
# that adds no information.
#
# "Choose" vs "Enter command"
#   "Choose [...]:"   one input is definitive/terminal (a choice).
#   "Enter command:"  inputs mutate pending on-screen state in a loop until a
#                     separate [C] Confirm (a command is a subset of choice).
#
# Vocabulary (locked)
#   [C] Confirm   [0] Exit / Main Menu / Back / Cancel (by depth/context)
#   [?] Help      multi-select: [A] All  [N] None  [#] Toggle
#   pager: [P] Previous  [N] Next     [X] is never used.
#   paged multi-select: [N] stays Next, so None becomes [Z]; [A]/[Z] act on the
#   current page only (Package & Persistence Manager).
#
# Input line (locked)
#   1. A blank line or a divider sits directly above the input line (a "Choose
#      [...]" prompt, or a nav line that is itself the input).
#   2. The "[P] Previous   Page X of Y   [N] Next" line is the line closest to the
#      input line (or is the input line).
#   3. Any other command lines go above it.
#   Prompt order: the page's range, then the footer's keys in reading order,
#   0 and ? last.
#
# Headings: L0 bold cyan, L1 cyan, L2 HDR2 lilac, all non-bold below the title.
#   An L2 heading inside a table is ONE word (more runs under the column headers).
#
# Naming (locked)
#   Functions and shell variables are plain snake_case - NEVER a leading
#   underscore. Scope function variables with `local` (declare every one); do
#   not use a _prefix as ad-hoc collision avoidance, that is what `local` is
#   for. Reserved exceptions, do not "clean up":
#     - _S_OK/_S_WARN/... , _TERM_PROFILE, _TERM_ORIG_SIZE, _TERM_RESTORED:
#       deliberate script-global symbol/state vars (uppercase, cross-function).
#     - variables inside the EMBEDDED JAVASCRIPT injected into the ttyd web UI
#       (manage_web_terminal): the _prefix there avoids colliding with the host
#       page's own globals. That is JS, not shell - leave it alone.
#   Before any bulk rename: check the function for embedded awk/JS/sed bodies,
#   and never reverse-rename single letters (\bn\b matches the n in "\n").
#
# [0] label by depth
#   root -> Exit ;  depth-1 child -> Main Menu ;  depth-2+ -> Back ;
#   pending/discard screen -> Cancel  (tie-break: does [0] discard pending state?)
#   free-text entry -> advertise cancel inline ("(1280-1500, 0 to cancel)"); a
#   deliberate backout (0 or empty) returns quietly - never an error.
#
# Prompt & flow rules
# 1. Disclose-then-ask, in exactly two parts: a disclosure and a terse prompt.
#    The disclosure (consequence of the non-default answer) is carried by status
#    message(s) - one or more, each properly iconed (ℹ️ info / ⚠️ warning) - OR
#    folded into the prompt line itself; never spread across a status line PLUS
#    separate UNPREFIXED body text. Each status line STATES, it never asks; the
#    one question is the terse prompt, phrased with a specific action verb (not a
#    generic "Continue/Yes"), especially for destructive actions. Don't re-ask
#    what the disclosure already said (no "Are you sure?"). Spacing depends on
#    what the disclosure IS - read => tight, scan => separated: inline PROSE (a
#    warning/explanation that is the decision's context) hugs the prompt, no blank
#    above it (Gestalt proximity); multiple independent warnings get one blank
#    BETWEEN them but still hug the prompt. A reviewable BLOCK the user scans - a
#    list, table, or change-summary - is its own region: separate it from the
#    action/prompt with one blank line or a divider (Gestalt common region; the
#    modal body-vs-footer pattern, same as a menu's options => "Choose").
#    Exception - a MID-FLOW interruption: when the disclosure+prompt appear AFTER the
#    user has already answered a DIFFERENT prompt in the same flow (e.g. typed a value,
#    then a "that requires X - proceed?" surprise), the disclosure (info or warning) is a
#    NEW component, not a leading disclosure - give it ONE blank line ABOVE it to detach it from the
#    finished entry, then hug its own prompt below as usual. (The action that follows
#    the answer still gets its one blank per rule 10.) See _netlimit_offload_ok.
# 2. Yes = the action; the capitalized default marks the safe side
#    (destructive => [y/N], expected/safe => [Y/n]). Never invert (no Yes=no-op).
# 3. Wording is the behavioral contract. Transition framing ("Enable it?") =>
#    N is a no-op (keep current). Declarative framing ("Should this persist?")
#    => N enforces the opposite (removes). Code MUST match the words. Prefer
#    transition framing for stateful toggles; never let N silently destroy.
# 4. State-first, valid transitions only. Show current state, then offer only
#    reachable transitions: for binary state, a single adaptive label that names
#    the concrete next action ("Enable X" when off / "Disable X" when on); an
#    action set (e.g. AGH Service Health [D]/[R]/[0]) for multi-state. Never force
#    the user to act twice to reach a state, and never label an item "Toggle" -
#    the label must state what it will do now. ([#] Toggle stays reserved for the
#    multi-select selection key, a different meaning.)
# 5. Check before you ask. Never present a [y/N] for an action already satisfied
#    or currently impossible. Refuse early and quietly when impossible;
#    warn-and-explain when already satisfied. No silent greying-out of menu
#    items without explanation.
# 6. Idempotent, truthful results. Report the ACTUAL delta ("Enabled" /
#    "Already set - no change" / "Removed" only when something was removed),
#    never a blanket success message.
# 7. Context-appropriate status. Every status/info/success/warning line must be
#    a direct response to the user's preceding action or answer. Never emit a
#    status about a topic the user didn't act on (no orphaned status). If a
#    state is worth surfacing absent a related action, fold it into the relevant
#    action's output rather than printing it standalone.
# 8. Ambient-state, not re-asked. For low-harm, easily reversible state, show
#    the state as status and expose the change as a named action: ask at most
#    once at the natural decision point, never re-ask once satisfied, always
#    offer a visible reversal. Forced/repeated confirmation is reserved for
#    destructive or irreversible actions.
#    A named menu action IS the decision - selecting it commits. Do NOT gate a
#    safe, reversible action behind [y/N]; confirm ONLY when the action is
#    destructive/irreversible (discards state the user set), or has side effects
#    the label doesn't convey (installs a package, mutates live state) - there
#    the disclosure earns the prompt. Don't confirm when the outcome is the
#    ideal/expected state with a visible reversal, or when the user already
#    typed the exact value (typing it IS the commit). Worked example - VPN MTU
#    Optimizer: Optimize and Set-manually do not ask; Reset ([y/N], it discards
#    the user's value) and the active probe ([y/N], it installs iputils and
#    briefly raises the live MTU) do.
#    A selector must never carry an action verb: "[A] All Tunnels" under an
#    "Optimize which tunnel?" header, never "[A] Optimize All Tunnels" - a verb
#    reads as a commit and turns any following prompt into a redundant re-ask.
#    Status word MATCHES the control verb, positive polarity. A state shown as status
#    reads in the SAME verb family as the action that changes it: a feature toggled with
#    Enable/Disable reports ENABLED/DISABLED (not ON/OFF); a device/service switched On/Off
#    or Start/Stop reports ON/OFF or RUNNING/STOPPED. Never pair an Enable/Disable control
#    with an ON/OFF readout, and (toggle-label std) the action label states what pressing
#    does NOW ("[H] Disable HW Acceleration"), never "Toggle". Name the THING in the label,
#    put the STATE in the value, positive-polarity - never a negated label with a boolean
#    ("Disabled: TRUE", "Not persisted: FALSE"): that forces a double-negative read. When a
#    state is desirable on one screen but not intrinsically "good" (HW Acceleration DISABLED
#    is the READY state on the Bandwidth Limiter), COLOR carries the health (green nominal /
#    yellow attention), not the word - see manage_netlimit.
# 9. Dwell mechanism. Match how a screen waits to its information value. User-
#    paced ("Press any key") for anything the user must READ - help, reports,
#    status/lists, and action results whose detail won't survive the return to a
#    cleared menu; also for any error needing user action. Timed auto-clear
#    (toast) ONLY for self-evident feedback that returns to a screen already
#    showing the situation: wrong-key validation (~1s) and content-bearing
#    no-op/cancel notices (~2s). Never zero-dwell - a message must never flash
#    and vanish with no pause.
# 10. Vertical spacing. One blank line is the unit of separation between
#     components (a section and the next prompt, a result and its footer).
#     Separators are leading-owned: the element BELOW emits the gap (a menu's
#     "\nChoose", press_any_key's leading "\n", a section's leading blank);
#     content never carries trailing blanks at a boundary - that is what causes
#     accidental double blanks. press_any_key is the single source of truth for
#     footer spacing (one blank); callers MUST NOT prepend printf "\n" before it.
#     Double blank lines are reserved for major in-screen section dividers only,
#     never at a component boundary. A printf "\n" is context-dependent: after
#     `read -r` (Enter echoed a newline) it is a BLANK line; after read_single_char
#     / `read -rsn1` / a bare prompt (no echoed newline) it is the line TERMINATOR,
#     not a blank - don't add a second expecting a gap. The single-source rule
#     generalizes beyond press_any_key: any function that emits its OWN leading
#     blank (press_any_key, agh_apply_and_restart) is the sole source of that
#     blank - callers MUST NOT emit a blank immediately before calling it.
#
# Status values (RATIFIED 2026-09-24 - settled, do not re-litigate)
#   A STATUS block is one titled block of contiguous "Label:  VALUE" rows, one fact per
#   row, values in one aligned column (Toolkit Management / the lifecycle screens). A
#   multi-field "A · B" row may only join values of ONE kind, and is avoided in STATUS.
#   A status value is a COLOURED ALL-CAPS WORD - never an emoji. Colour follows what the
#   state MEANS for that feature (RAGG): green = healthy/nominal; yellow = worth a look -
#   partial, BETA, BYPASSED, a reading that SHOULD work but failed, or a deliberate
#   departure from GL's defaults that could cause harm (no root password, SSH password or
#   root login off = lockout risk, fan limit above factory, no AGH login with Direct UI
#   Access on); red = broken (SERVICE DOWN, DOWN, MISSING) - a user's choice is never red;
#   grey = inactive - off by choice, not present, not measured yet, or a no-op (DISABLED,
#   NOT INSTALLED, NOT DETECTED on a model without that hardware, NONE - e.g. no backups
#   yet - No Change). DISABLED went yellow -> grey 2026-09-24 after a readability test;
#   NONE followed 2026-09-25 (an empty list isn't "worth a look").
#   Not status values, but fixed here so they stay put: explanatory FOOTNOTES under a table
#   are grey (de-emphasised prose, not a state); a COMMAND the user copies (iperf3 -c ...) is
#   cyan like a URL; a key hint that EXPOSES sensitive data ([*] Reveal / Hide on Hardware
#   Info) is yellow as a caution - every other key hint is default. File paths inside a
#   message take the message's colour, never grey. Headings and column headers are Title
#   Case - and so are MENU ITEM labels and key-bar words ("Enable Persistence", "Check for
#   Updates", "[0] Main Menu"; minor words - a, an, and, or, the, to, of, for, via, in, on, from, by -
#   stay lowercase unless first). Messages and prompts stay in sentence case; a status VALUE is ALL
#   CAPS (Channel: BETA) while the same name in a label or message is a proper noun (Switch to Beta
#   Channel). ALL CAPS is reserved for ROLE labels - a block label naming the role the block
#   plays on the screen, not its topic: STATUS, and Remote LAN Access OUTBOUND / INBOUND.
#   On a confirm or result screen each group label takes its ACTION's colour (green =
#   install/enable/add, yellow = caution/disable, red = remove) in Title Case (AGH Lists
#   Manager "Install + Enable:", Package Manager "To Be Installed or Persisted:").
#   Forward context: a detail screen reached from a list keeps the colour that list gave
#   the state, even where the standalone rule would pick another - drilling in never
#   changes a state's colour (Bandwidth Limiter: BLOCKED is red in the network list, so it
#   stays red on that network's edit screen).
#   Lifecycle states come from _lc_value so every feature reads identically. Keys are
#   default/white; plain FACT values (versions, sizes, counts, dates, temperatures, file
#   paths, SSIDs/keys, speeds, addresses) are BLUE - the same pale blue as info messages
#   ($BLUE, 38;5;153), so "blue = what you're told, RAGG = how it's judged".
#   Indent cascade (2026-09-24): label/value colours shift one step per indent level,
#   relative to the screen. Where a screen has an indent, an OUTDENTED (heading-level)
#   label is cyan and its plain fact value is DEFAULT ("WAN address: 192.168.12.216") -
#   cyan beside blue reads as one smudge; an INDENTED key is white with a BLUE value. A
#   one-level screen is white key + blue value. A table counts as indented content under
#   the label above it (Package Manager "Storage:"). State words keep their RAGG colour at
#   every level and URLs stay cyan. Parentheses: a FACT inside them (address, interface,
#   member ports) follows its value's colour; COMMENTARY ("(default)", "(can raise)",
#   "(pid 123)") stays default - never grey, which means inactive.
#   Tables (T-A): a table about THIS router (ports, leases, routes, firewall rules, DNS
#   results) follows the key/value rule - row name white, fact columns blue, state columns
#   RAGG. A table comparing OTHER devices (benchmarks) leaves their rows default and marks
#   this device bold blue. Pickers (Package Manager list) keep their own action colours.
#   A table's column-header row is its key row -> default, never cyan. A group label that
#   splits a table's rows (Hardware Info "SoC ports" / "Switch ports", AGH Lists Manager
#   sections) is an L2 heading ($HDR2), outdented one step from the rows it groups.
#   URLs are LINKS and are cyan, in status rows (Direct URL) and in messages alike. Emoji
#   belong to MESSAGES (print_success/warning/error/info) and to graded matrix columns (the
#   Remote LAN Access reachability table) - not to status rows.
#
# Menu items never dead-end (RATIFIED 2026-09-25 - settled, do not re-litigate)
#   A numbered item must DO something in every state it's offered. Three rules, in order:
#   1. NOT SUPPORTED by the hardware/firmware (no fan, no switch, no filter-limit support): the
#      STATUS says so (grey NOT DETECTED / NOT SUPPORTED), one warning line, and only 0 Back.
#   2. A NO-OP BECOMES A REAL OPERATION in the same slot: relabel it to a genuine re-check that
#      re-scans and redraws ("Check for Updates", "Check for Package System Issues", "Check for
#      Backups", "Recalculate Recommended MTU") - something may have changed since the screen
#      loaded (another terminal, the web UI). If the re-check finds work, the real action appears
#      on the redraw. A relabel that just prints "nothing to do" is NOT allowed - and a silent
#      redraw isn't either: a re-check shows its progress (spinner) and ends with a result line
#      ("No package system issues found", "Found 2 backups - choose Restore") before the redraw.
#   3. DROP an item only when it is the LAST numbered item before Back, so no other number shifts
#      or leaves a gap (MTU "Reset MTU" with no override; Bandwidth Limiter "Disable Limit" with no
#      limit - placed last for that reason; "Delete a Backup" with none saved). Optional, never
#      required. A toggle pair is always ONE slot labelled with what pressing does now.
#   Never grey out a menu item: it doesn't say what would make it available.
#
# Help screens
#   Navigation menus AND numbered action/selection menus get a [?] Help entry
#   (rule broadened 2026-07-31 - MTU/RLA/VPN Tools were numbered action screens
#   with no help; they now have it). Pure pickers, binary-state toggles and
#   confirm dialogs still do NOT. [?] is dispatched as `\?|h|H|❓` (not the words
#   "help"/"HELP"), advertised as `printf "%s Help\n" "$NQ"` - ONE space at the call
#   site, because NQ carries its own trailing space so Help aligns with the
#   two-space numbered rows above it. `?` is added to
#   the Choose prompt.
#   Help content is generic and idempotent (NO option numbers - describe actions
#   by name), body opens with the title line "<Feature> - Quick Help", uses
#   `Section\n────` headers with `──` box-drawing dividers and `•` bullets. The
#   universal keys ([0]/[?]) are explained ONCE, in the main-menu help - inner
#   screens don't repeat them. A body needing the router's LAN IP uses an
#   unquoted heredoc + $(get_lan_ip), never a hardcoded address.
#
# Menu & picker input
#   Input mode is decided at the FUNCTIONAL-GROUP level, by constraint:
#     - A group containing any live/refreshing screen (or a paged VIEW like the
#       Hardware Info / Display Settings pagers) is KEY-ONLY - a single keypress
#       (read_single_char, or read -t for refresh); a blocking read would freeze
#       the redraw.
#     - Otherwise the group is KEY + ENTER (read -r) if any member can present a
#       multi-character token: an item number that reaches >=10, or a multi-char
#       command like "CL". ALL members of that group then use key+Enter for
#       consistency, even fixed <=9-item screens within it.
#     - A standalone fixed-<=9 single-char screen MAY be key-only, but never when
#       grouped with a line-based sibling. Text/value entry is always key+Enter.
#     - All major navigation menus are key+Enter.
#   The input prompt is separated from the options/action-bar block by ONE blank
#   line (Gestalt common region: options are a content region, the prompt is the
#   action). Wording is "Choose [<keys>]:" - the bracket lists valid keys, with
#   the item token from picker_range(): the live count as a range ("1-10"), but
#   just "1" for a single item (a range only when there IS a range - never
#   "1-1"), and never a literal "#".
#
# Rendering note
#   Trailing "\033[K" (erase-to-EOL) is load-bearing on in-place redraw screens
#   (fan / status / spinner). Do NOT remove it there.
#
# Progress indicators
#   spin_run (gear/⚙) = indeterminate wait - duration unknown until the command
#   finishes (opkg, openssl, a dd test whose throughput we're measuring).
#   countdown_run (hourglass/⏳) = determinate wait - the caller already knows
#   and told the user the total duration (e.g. a fixed-length stress test); it
#   counts down instead of spinning. Pick by determinacy, not by "which looks
#   nicer" - showing a spinner when the duration is already known withholds
#   information the user was already given.
#
# Table & List Alignment
#   Column justification is decided per-column by a 3-part test - right-justify
#   ONLY if all three hold, else left-justify:
#     1. Values are NOT normalized to near-constant width (i.e. not auto-scaled
#        across units specifically to keep text length ~constant regardless of
#        magnitude - that scaling defeats the entire mechanism right-justify
#        relies on: comparing magnitude by digit position).
#     2. No other element in the row (a bar, icon, or color) already shows
#        relative magnitude.
#     3. The reader's task is genuinely comparing/summing many values, not
#        reading one row as a self-contained status card about one entity.
#   Fails any of the three -> left-justify uniformly (Docker/kubectl-style: all
#   columns left, including numeric-looking ones - this is the default for our
#   small device-comparison leaderboards and toggle/checkbox lists).
#   A column's header MUST share its data row's exact format string (or at
#   minimum identical field-width declarations) wherever feasible - a
#   hand-typed separate header string WILL drift from computed data over time;
#   this is the root cause behind every alignment bug found in this audit.
#   Never center a column header. Screen/section TITLES (print_centered_header)
#   are a different UI element (a heading, not a table column) and are exempt.
#   Boolean/toggle indicators use tight brackets: [Y] [N] [✓] [ ] - content
#   flush against both brackets, no internal space padding. Under a column
#   header, a checkbox/toggle IS centered within its field (the one explicit
#   exception to "never center") - it is a symbol/glyph, not text or a
#   magnitude to compare, and the header word above it stays left-justified
#   per the normal text rule; the two don't need to share a visual midpoint,
#   just the same declared field width.
#   Placeholder/null-value markers (e.g. "---") that mean "not applicable"
#   rather than a real value ARE exempt from the column's justification and
#   may be centered within their field - they are not content being compared,
#   they are a symbol of incomparability, and distinct treatment aids scanning.
#   Centering with an odd remainder (can't split the padding evenly): give the
#   extra space to the right, so content sits one space left of true-center,
#   never right of it.
#   Out of scope: output piped directly from an external command (df, dd) that
#   has its own native formatting; vertical Label: Value blocks (System
#   Information, STATUS panels) which aren't row/column tables at all.
#
# Naming
#   Functions: lowercase snake_case, NO leading underscore, descriptive verb-led
#   (check_*, get_*, is_*, manage_*, show_*, install_*). A leading "_" is reserved
#   for internal runtime STATE variables only (_S_* mode symbols, _TERM_PROFILE).
#   Comments describe the code AS-IS, not its history - changelogs/diffs carry that.

AdGuardHome Updates & Channel - Quick Help

Status
───────────────────────────────
• Channel  → STABLE (AdGuard's stable line) or BETA (AdGuard's pre-release line)
  Version  → the AdGuardHome build installed now
  Update   → UP TO DATE, AVAILABLE (with the newer version), or UNKNOWN when the
             router can't reach AdGuard's update server. Checked once per session.

Updates via UI
───────────────────────────────
Controls the updater built into AdGuardHome's own web dashboard. When ENABLED the
dashboard can offer and install new AdGuardHome versions; when DISABLED it can't
(the --no-check-update flag is added). GL.iNet ships it DISABLED.

Update to vX / Check for Updates
───────────────────────────────
Updates AdGuardHome to the newest build of its channel, using AdGuardHome's own
updater - it works whether or not Updates via UI is enabled. config.yaml is backed
up first; AdGuardHome restarts on the new version. When there's no update, the same
option checks again now.

An update can upgrade config.yaml to a newer format that GL.iNet's build can't
read. To go back: Factory Reset (restores GL.iNet's build and config), or restore a
config.yaml backup from Backup & Recovery.

Channel: Stable or Beta
───────────────────────
• STABLE → AdGuard's current stable release. GL.iNet ships a stable build with
           the firmware; switching or updating moves to AdGuard's newest.
• BETA   → AdGuard's pre-release build: newest features, less tested

Switching channels downloads that channel's current build (about 11 MB, 34 MB
installed). config.yaml is checked against the new build first and KEPT - if
the build can't read it, nothing changes. It's also backed up first, and if the
new build won't start, the previous version and config.yaml are put back.
To return to an earlier version, restore from backup in Backup & Recovery.

Newer builds upgrade config.yaml to a format GL.iNet's firmware build can't
read. A firmware update puts that build back, so AdGuardHome won't start after
it unless persistence is enabled. The Persistence row turns yellow when that
applies, and you're offered persistence after an update or switch.

In this menu you can:
• Enable or disable Updates via UI (adds/removes the --no-check-update flag).
• Enable or disable persistence, so an updated build survives firmware updates.
• Switch between the Stable and Beta channels.
• Update to the newest build of the channel, or check for updates.

Note: Changing this setting restarts AdGuardHome automatically if already started. 
      Your filtering rules and stats are preserved.

# -----------------------------
# AdGuardHome release channel: Stable = GL.iNet's factory build (/rom), Beta = AdGuard's beta
# -----------------------------
# Evidence behind this design (measured on the fleet 2026-09-23):
#  • AdGuard's own builds support --glinet, so GL's integrated mode keeps working on Beta.
#  • Beta upgrades config.yaml to a newer schema (33 -> 34) that GL's build refuses ("unknown
#    current schema version 34"), so config.yaml is backed up before the switch and restored on
#    the way back to Stable.
#  • --check-config REWRITES the file it checks and exits 0 even when it fails, so configs are
#    validated on a COPY and judged by its output.
#  • A firmware update keeps config.yaml but reinstalls GL's binary, so Beta without update
#    persistence comes back unable to start - hence the persistence offer after switching.

AdGuardHome Filter Space Limit - Quick Help

Why the limit exists
────────────────────
On 512MB RAM routers (MT3600BE, some newer GL models), GL.iNet creates a 10MB file 
and mounts it as /etc/AdGuardHome/data/filters. This caps filter cache space to 
prevent AdGuardHome from consuming too much RAM and crashing the router.

Removing this limit lets you use bigger blocklists (e.g. HaGeZi Pro++, multi-list setups), 
but significantly increases RAM usage when filters are loaded/updated.

Risks if you remove it without mitigation
─────────────────────────────────────────
• High RAM pressure → router slowdown, OOM killer, or crashes
• Especially bad with many clients, VPN, or heavy filtering

Strong recommendation
─────────────────────
Enable **zram swap** first (Advanced Settings → Zram Swap → Install & Enable).
Zram gives fast compressed swap in RAM, greatly reduces memory pressure,
and is safe for most GL.iNet 512MB devices. The Lists Manager also offers to
enable zram automatically when a selection would run memory high.

Only remove the limit after zram is active.

The menu
────────
Item 1 is one toggle labelled with what it will do: Disable Filter Space Limit
while it's ACTIVE, Enable Filter Space Limit while it's INACTIVE. Models and
firmware without GL.iNet's limit show NOT SUPPORTED and offer only Back.

Re-enabling the limit
─────────────────────
If your installed lists are already larger than the cap, turning the limit back
on will warn you (space used vs. available) and ask you to confirm - lists that
don't fit silently stop loading, so remove some first or leave the limit off.

AdGuardHome Lists Manager - Quick Help

What it does
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pick which DNS filter lists AdGuardHome installs and enables. Each list has
two toggles:

  • Install  - the list is present in AdGuardHome's config
  • Enable   - AdGuardHome actually loads and uses it

Typing a list's number cycles it through the sensible steps for its current
state, and the Planned Action column shows exactly what will happen:

  • a Missing list    ->  Install + Enable  ->  Install (leave off)  ->  no change
  • an Active list    ->  Remove  ->  Disable  ->  no change
  • an Inactive list  ->  Enable  ->  Remove  ->  no change

Nothing is applied until you press [C] Confirm and approve the summary.

The screen
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  • Memory Impact (top): a bar of the rules that will actually load, against
    this box's RAM (plus zram swap if enabled). Green is comfortable; it turns
    (high)/(critical) as the enabled lists approach what the box can hold.
  • Size: each list's rule count - a real count once downloaded, a "~"
    estimate before then, or FAILED when an enabled list couldn't download.
  • Under the meter: how many enabled lists are still downloading (their
    counts are estimates until finished), and how many failed - a failed
    list loads nothing, so the meter doesn't count it.
  • AdGuardHome not running: the manager still opens, with a warning on top.
    Lists are part of its config, so they can be staged either way. If it's
    SERVICE DOWN, Confirm applies the lists and starts it; if it's DISABLED,
    Confirm asks whether to enable it - say no and the lists are saved for
    when it's enabled. Nothing downloads while it's stopped, so the
    "downloading" line is left out until it runs.
  • Sections: Recommended (a curated, safe default set), General, Security,
    Allowlist, and Other (lists already in your config that aren't in this
    catalog).

Staying safe on small boxes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Before applying a heavy set, the manager can:

  • offer to enable zram swap (compressed RAM headroom) when memory would run
    high on a low-RAM router; and
  • warn - on models with a filter-storage cap - when the selection won't fit,
    offering to remove the cap (also under Advanced Settings).

After applying, it waits for the newly-enabled lists to download - showing
progress - so the screen doesn't look hung and the Memory Impact meter is
accurate on return. Lists that finish are confirmed; any that could not fit
(storage full) are reported and removed so nothing is left half-installed; any
still downloading are noted as in-progress (AdGuardHome keeps retrying).

# --- AGH filter-download log signals ------------------------------------------------

# This is the PRIMARY source for a list whose on-disk file hasn't landed yet - right after
# an apply, AGH downloads asynchronously, so the file lags but the log settles first, and a
# failure line is the definitive "actually zero" signal vs "still downloading". It is only a
# RESOLVER: the on-disk file (wc) stays the authoritative count when present, and if logread
# is unavailable or AGH changes its format the scan comes back empty and callers fall back to
# the file + catalog estimate (never the old exclude-and-under-count). logread is a pipe, so
# no empty-file-arg stdin hazard. See [[agh-lists-manager-backlog]].

AdGuardHome Direct UI Access - Quick Help

What it does
────────────
Reach the AdGuardHome dashboard directly, bypassing the GL.iNet admin login.

  • ON:  the dashboard is served at http://${lan_ip}:${ui_port}
  • OFF: port ${ui_port} redirects to port 80 (the standard GL.iNet login)

Web UI credentials
──────────────────
Bypassing the GL.iNet login removes its protection, so a username and password
are set on AdGuardHome itself (a secure bcrypt hash). Set these before leaving
Direct Access on, or the dashboard is open to anyone on your LAN.

Remove password
───────────────
Clears the AdGuardHome credentials, leaving the dashboard fully open on the LAN.
Use only if you want no login at all.

Notes
─────
  • Safety copies: the init script and config.yaml are copied before each change
    and put back if AdGuardHome won't start; the copy is removed once the change
    is confirmed (use Backup & Recovery for backups you want to keep).
  • Persistence: a firmware update overwrites the init script - re-enable
    Direct Access afterwards to restore it.

AdGuardHome Control Center - Quick Help

What it does
────────────
The hub for AdGuardHome (the router's DNS ad-blocker): control the service,
manage filter lists, run backups, and reach the dashboard.

What each item does
───────────────────
STATUS: AdGuardHome reads ENABLED (running), DISABLED (you turned it off) or
   SERVICE DOWN (switched on but not running). Config reads MISSING when
   config.yaml is gone. Direct UI Access shows whether the dashboard has its own
   address - when it does, the address is listed on the next row.

SERVICE: Item 1 follows the state - Enable or Disable the daemon, Restart it
   when it is switched on but not running, or Recover Configuration when
   config.yaml is missing (restore a backup, or reset to factory defaults if
   there is none). Everyday restarts live under Logs & Maintenance.

ALLOW/BLOCKLISTS: Add or remove filter subscriptions (block and allow lists).

ADVANCED SETTINGS: the filter storage-space limit, Zram Swap, Direct UI Access
   (the dashboard's own address and login), and Updates & Channel (updates,
   Updates via UI, persistence, and switching between Stable and Beta).

BACKUP SUITE:
   - SAVE: Generates timestamped sync points for Config and Binary.
   - RESTORE: Allows modular injection of previous system states.
   - MANAGE: Cleanup utility to purge redundant backup files.

LOGS & MAINTENANCE:
   - LOGS: Real-time 'logread' stream for diagnostic observation.
   - CACHE: Flushes filter data to resolve download/checksum errors.
   - RESTART: Bounces the running daemon to reload config.yaml or clear a
     wedge. If the service is disabled, it points you to item 1 to enable it.

FACTORY RESET: Reconstructs the environment using read-only firmware
   defaults located in the /rom partition.

NOTES:
- Edits apply when AdGuardHome restarts. If the service is stopped, changes
  are saved and take effect the next time you start it.
- RULE DISCREPANCY: 'Raw' counts include all text lines. The Web UI
  displays a lower 'Optimized' count after deduplication.
- 10MB LIMIT: Crucial for routers with small flash storage. When
  active, it restricts filter space to prevent storage exhaustion.
- LOGS: Query logs are often in /tmp (RAM). If 'Free Space' is 
  low, the system may become unstable.

Groups the AdGuardHome settings that aren't day-to-day filtering:

  • Filter Storage Space Limit - how much room its filter data may use
  • Zram Swap - compressed RAM swap; adds memory headroom so more/larger
    lists can load without exhausting RAM
  • Direct UI Access & Web UI login - reach the dashboard directly, with its
    own username and password
  • Updates & Channel - update AdGuardHome, Updates via UI, persistence, and
    switching between the Stable and Beta channels

Each item opens its own screen with full details and its own help.

AdGuardHome Backup & Recovery - Quick Help

What it does
────────────
Create, restore and manage backups of your AdGuardHome setup.

What a backup contains
──────────────────────
You pick what to save: the configuration (config.yaml), the startup script and
the AdGuardHome binary. GL.iNet's own build is always restorable from the
firmware (/rom), so it's never copied (shown as "rom"). Each backup records
its Version, Channel and config Schema, shown in the restore and cleanup lists.

Before an update, channel switch or restore, the toolkit saves a config-only
backup automatically, so flash isn't spent on binaries.

Restoring
─────────
A backup is only restored if the build that will run it can read its config.
If it can't, the toolkit says so (update first) rather than leaving AdGuardHome
unable to start. If the restored setup doesn't start, the previous one is put
back.

Notes
─────
  • Backups are timestamped, so you can keep several and roll back to any one
    if a change goes wrong.
  • With no backups yet, item 2 is Check for Backups - it re-scans the store.
  • They are stored centrally in /etc/glinet_utils/backups and survive a reboot;
    older in-place backups are moved there automatically.
  • A firmware update can replace the binary and script; restore a backup to
    recover.

What it does
────────────
Diagnostics and upkeep for AdGuardHome: watch its live logs, clear its cached
filter files, and restart the running daemon.

When to use
───────────
  • Live logs - to see what AdGuardHome is doing (queries, blocks, errors),
    e.g. after changing filter lists.
  • Clear cache - to force it to re-fetch filter data if a list looks stale.
  • Restart - to reload config.yaml or clear a wedge without a full disable/
    enable. Works while running; if disabled, it points you to item 1 to enable.

Note: enabling and disabling the service is on the Control Center (item 1);
restart is an operational bounce and lives here.

Zram Swap – Quick Help

What is zram swap?
──────────────────
Zram creates a compressed block device in your router's RAM and uses it as swap space. 
Instead of writing swap data to slow flash storage (which wears it out quickly), zram 
compresses the data and keeps it in RAM. This is much faster and protects your NAND/eMMC.

Main benefits on GL.iNet routers:
• Greatly improves performance when RAM is low (e.g. heavy VPN, AdGuardHome, many clients)
• Reduces lag and stuttering under memory pressure
• Does not use or impact the router's flash storage
• Uses minimal CPU overhead on modern router SoCs

Typical recommendations:
• 50% of total RAM is a good starting size (e.g. 256 MB on a 512 MB router)
• Most GL.iNet users enable it if they run AdGuardHome + VPN or have ≥10–15 devices connected

When should you use it?
Yes → if your router frequently runs out of RAM or you notice slowdowns
No  → if you have 1 GB+ RAM and very light usage

Important notes:
• Zram uses some CPU to compress/decompress → not ideal on very old/slow CPUs
• Data in zram is lost on reboot (normal for swap)
• Routers with 512MB flash or less will have a forced limit for AdGuardHome allow/block lists.

Reach this screen from System Tweaks, or from AdGuardHome -> Advanced Settings
-> Zram Swap (it pairs with the filter storage-space limit).

Status + actions (the menu is context-aware - it shows only what applies):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Zram Swap line shows one of:
• NOT INSTALLED - the zram-swap package isn't installed.
• DISABLED      - installed, but zram swap is off (the package is kept).
• ENABLED       - on, with a zram device active in the swap table.
• SERVICE DOWN  - it's enabled but no zram device is swapping (it didn't come up).

Actions by state:
• Install and enable - installs the zram-swap package, then enables and starts it.
  (Shown when NOT INSTALLED.)
• Enable  - turns it back on (instant - the package is already there).
• Disable - stops zram swap but KEEPS the package and config, so re-enabling is
  instant and lossless.
• Reinstall - the fix for SERVICE DOWN: reinstalls the package and restarts it.
  (Shown only when SERVICE DOWN.)
• Uninstall - removes the zram-swap package and its persistence entries entirely.
• Enable/Disable Persistence - re-install zram swap automatically after a firmware
  update (adds it to the boot re-install list). Available once it is enabled.

Fan Management – Quick Help

How the Fan Controller Works:
─────────────────────────────
The /usr/bin/gl_fan process uses a PID-style controller to manage speed 
based on three primary temperature setpoints.

The Setpoints Explained:
• Minimum: The temperature where the fan starts spinning at its lowest 
  voltage. Setting this higher keeps the fan off longer.
• Fan-On: The "Target" temperature. The controller will ramp the fan up 
  toward 100% speed as it approaches and exceeds this value.
• Warning: Primarily used for system logs and UI alerts. Usually set 
  equal to or slightly higher than the Fan-On setpoint.
• Max: This script's custom "Unlock." It extends the slider range
  in the web interface, allowing you to set thresholds up to 120°C.

Thermal Hierarchy (Safety Rules):
─────────────────────────────────
To prevent logic loops, the following rules are enforced:
  Minimum ≤ Fan-On ≤ Max
  Warning must be between Minimum and Max.

Dynamic vs. Manual Mode:
• Dynamic: The system automatically adjusts RPM based on heat.
• Static: Holds the fan at a set percentage (0-100%) and turns off GL's own
  fan service while it does. The speed is kept across reboots until you
  choose Enable Dynamic Fan Control.

Safety Warning:
────────────────
Extending limits beyond 100°C can lead to hardware throttling or
emergency shutdowns. Most silicon is rated for ~105°C. Use 110°C+
only if you understand the thermal risks to your specific model.

Web-UI note:
────────────
The Max "unlock" patches the Admin Panel bundle that the Web-UI Terminal
button and the Switch-Position indicator also use. They share one injection
registry now, so changing Fan settings re-paints those overlays rather than
wiping them (and a factory reset drops only the Fan patch). The panel picks up
the change on your next visit - no refresh needed (the bundle is re-hashed so the
browser fetches it fresh).

Persistence (option 8):
───────────────────────
Reboots are always fine. A firmware upgrade resets the Admin Panel, dropping
the fan setpoint patch, and forgets a static speed. Turn on "Enable
Persistence" (a setpoint or a static speed must be set first) and a small boot
service re-applies both on the new firmware's first boot, reporting the result
on the next launch. If the new panel changed so the patch no longer fits, it is
left stock (never corrupted) and reported as unable to restore.

# lasts until the next boot (gl_fan comes back and takes over). So the speed is stored in the toolkit's
# OWN file and a tiny boot service holds it; Enable Dynamic Fan Control removes both. Not in GL's glfan
# config: setting a setpoint (_fan_apply) resets glfan from /rom and silently erased it (found in a real
# firmware update on a BE14000, 2026-09-28). Firmware updates are covered by fan persistence.
# PIDs of processes NAMED exactly $1 (their /proc comm). busybox `pgrep -x` doesn't match a process started
# by full path (procd's /usr/bin/gl_fan, /usr/sbin/tailscaled) and `pidof` misses some too - found on the
# fleet 2026-09-29; `pgrep -f` from an ssh command line matches itself. Names are <= 15 chars (comm).

Network Bandwidth Limiter - Quick Help

Sets a download/upload speed ceiling on any of the router's networks - guest, IoT,
a LAN, a VLAN, or a VPN tunnel - discovered automatically (a network only appears if
it exists on this device). Switched-off guest / IoT / VLAN networks are shown too,
marked DOWN, so you can bring them back up from here.

The grid
--------
  * Each row is a network: its If-State (UP, or DOWN if it's switched off), its Download /
    Upload limits, whether it can reach the router itself (Router), whether the limit persists
    across firmware upgrades, and whether a limit is ACTIVE right now (a limit shows BYPASSED
    if HW acceleration is on, since offload skips the shaper). Router and Status are MEASURED
    from the live firewall and tc state, not from stored settings.
  * Pick a number to open that network and set its limits.
  * [R] Reset reverts everything to defaults: removes every limit and router rule,
    re-enables HW acceleration, and stops the background service (asks first).

Hardware acceleration
---------------------
  * Shaping needs the software forwarding path, so it can't run while HW acceleration is
    enabled. This is automatic: setting a limit DISABLES acceleration for the whole router,
    and clearing your last limit re-enables it - you don't normally touch it.
  * The status line at the top reports it. DISABLED (green) is the normal state while you
    shape. ENABLED is green when you have no limits (nothing is bypassed) and turns YELLOW
    if it is on while a limit exists - that limit is then BYPASSED (offload skips the
    shaper) until acceleration is disabled again.
  * [H] is a manual override (Enable / Disable) of that automatic behaviour. You rarely
    need it - it's there to force acceleration on or off independently of your limits.
  * What it costs (measured): shaping moves forwarding into software, so the CPU does more
    per packet. On a dual-core MediaTek router pushing ~309 Mbit/s of routed traffic, CPU
    went from about 8% with offload ON to about 48% with it OFF - and the software path on
    that class of chip tops out near 700 Mbit/s. So on a 1 Gbps WAN there's comfortable
    headroom for everyday use; it bites harder on 2.5G/10G links or when you're near that
    ceiling. Faster CPUs (newer Flint-class routers) pay far less.

Per-network options
-------------------
  * Download / Upload: a ceiling in Mbps; 0 removes that direction.
  * Router access: whether this network can reach the router's OWN services (admin UI,
    speedtest, NTP, SSH, ...) on its LAN IP - not other devices on the LAN subnet. Measured
    live from the firewall and shown with a RAG dot (green = reachable, matching the Remote
    LAN Access screen):
      - reachable (green)  every port on the router is reachable (all ports)
      - partial   (yellow) only some ports - typically the DNS/DHCP that GL opens by
                           default; the detail page lists exactly which (service/port/proto)
      - blocked   (red)    no router services reachable at all (rare)
    "Enable Router to Be Reachable on All Ports" opens every port; the matching "Disable ..."
    removes only that and falls back to partial (it does NOT block - DNS/DHCP keep working).
    On an ISOLATED network (walled off from your other networks) it warns and confirms first,
    since opening all ports also exposes the router's admin UI / SSH to that network.
    Networks whose zone already accepts input (the LAN,
    and typically VPN zones) are "managed by zone" and not toggled here - that would risk
    locking you out. (Only ACCEPT rules are counted; hand-written nft rules outside uci are
    not, and the exact reachable set can differ if custom DROP rules interleave.)
  * Persistence: a limit ALWAYS survives a reboot (the service is enabled and its config
    lives on the overlay). This keeps it across a firmware UPGRADE too, by adding it to the
    sysupgrade backup - so "NO" means reboot-safe but lost on a firmware upgrade.
  * Disable: remove the limit entirely.
  * Bring interface(s) UP / DOWN: switch a guest / IoT / VLAN network on or off - a persistent
    change, like the GL admin toggle, so it survives a reboot. A network with multiple Wi-Fi
    bands (2.4 / 5 / 6 GHz) opens a grid where you pick which bands to bring up or down - the
    network reads UP while any band is up, DOWN once all are off; single-interface networks (a
    wired VLAN) toggle as a whole. A guest / IoT network that's also fed by a wired or tagged VLAN
    port (e.g. to a VLAN-aware access point) stays UP with every band off - the ports are listed
    under If-State as Wired/VLAN, and switching its bands off never takes those ports down. A switched-off network offers only "Bring interface(s) UP",
    since limits and router access don't apply until it's up. The LAN and VPN tunnels are never
    toggled here. Turning bands on/off briefly re-applies Wi-Fi, so other wireless may drop for
    a moment.

Switch Position Indicator – Quick Help

What it does
────────────
Many GL.iNet routers have a physical toggle / slide switch. The stock admin panel's
Toggle Button Settings page lets you ASSIGN a function to it, but never shows which
way it is actually flipped. This overlay fills that gap: on that page it fills the
currently-selected side's toggle GREEN, greens its LEFT/RIGHT label, and tags it
"current position". The overlay itself never moves the switch or changes a setting;
option 3 below lets you ASSIGN the switch's function, the same as GL's own page.

The STATUS lines
────────────────
• Hardware: whether this model has a switch (and the GPIO it uses).
• Position: which side the switch is on now (LEFT / RIGHT). Derived the way GL labels
  the two slots - LEFT = the function's ON (pressed) side, RIGHT = OFF (released) -
  from the logical state (GPIO level XOR active-low), not a raw guess.
• Toggle function: what the switch is set to DO, read from GL's own config (e.g.
  WireGuard, VPN, Tor) - NONE if none is assigned. When a function IS assigned, a
  State row under it shows ON/OFF: the same logical pressed/released state GL's own
  button handler acts on, derived the way GL derives it.
• Indicator: the one lifecycle value for the overlay + its backend reader (they are
  linked, so they share one state):
  - DISABLED     - the overlay is off.
  - ENABLED      - the overlay is injected and the background reader is live, so the
                   panel's indicator stays current when you flip the switch.
  - SERVICE DOWN - the overlay is on but the background reader died, so the panel
                   would go stale. Use Reinstall to recover.
• Persistence: whether the indicator is re-applied automatically after a firmware
  update (ENABLED) or would need a manual re-enable (DISABLED).

How it works
────────────
• Backend (gl_switchpos): a tiny Procd service reads the switch GPIO and publishes
  the position to /www/gl-switchpos.json (only on change - negligible flash wear).
• Frontend (JS overlay): the shared glwebui registry appends a small script to the
  admin-panel bundle that polls that file and paints the active side. It draws only
  on the Toggle Button Settings page.

Status + actions (the menu is context-aware - it shows only what applies)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Enable: writes + starts the backend service and injects the overlay. (Shown when
  DISABLED.)
• Disable: removes the overlay and stops/removes the backend service. (Shown when
  ENABLED or SERVICE DOWN - there is no package to keep, so Disable is its removal.)
• Reinstall: the fix for SERVICE DOWN - re-writes the backend, restarts it, and
  re-injects the overlay. Also handy after a firmware upgrade resets the panel.
  (Shown only when SERVICE DOWN.)
• Set toggle button function: assign what the switch does (No Function, Repeater,
  Wi-Fi, a VPN tunnel, LED, ...). The choices come from GL's own handlers + tunnel
  list - the same set as GL's Toggle Button Settings dropdown. It takes effect on
  the next flip / reboot (GL's behavior), so nothing toggles the moment you set it.
  Assigning Wi-Fi warns first, since a flip can then drop the Wi-Fi you manage over.
• Enable Persistence: keep the indicator across firmware updates. A firmware upgrade
  wipes the overlay; with persistence on, a small boot service re-applies it from the
  new firmware's bundle on first boot, and the result is shown on the next launch. If
  the new firmware changed the panel so the overlay no longer fits, it is left stock
  (never corrupted) and reported as unable to restore.

Coexists with other Web-UI tweaks
─────────────────────────────────
The Web-UI Terminal button, the Fan slider range, and this indicator all paint the
same admin-panel bundle. The shared registry re-applies every ACTIVE overlay from
the pristine bundle on each change, so installing or removing one never wipes the
others.

• Install/remove appears on your next visit to the panel - no refresh needed
  (the toolkit re-hashes the bundle so the browser fetches it fresh).
• The overlay survives a reboot; a firmware UPGRADE resets the panel. Turn on
  "Enable Persistence" (option 4) to have it re-applied automatically, or re-install
  by hand after upgrading (same as the other Web-UI tweaks).

Web Terminal (ttyd) Management – Quick Help

What is the Web Terminal?
───────────────────────────
This tool embeds a fully functional Linux terminal directly into your 
GL.iNet Admin Panel. It allows you to execute commands, edit configs, 
and manage your router without needing an external SSH client.

Main Benefits:
• Zero Config: Access your shell from any browser (Safari/Chrome/Edge).
• Secure: Uses '/bin/login' to require your root password.
• Integrated: Adds a custom icon ( >_ ) to the top navigation bar.

How it Works (The Technical Bit):
────────────────────────────────
• Backend (ttyd): A lightweight C-based terminal-to-web server that 
  runs as a Procd service (Start Priority: 99).
• Frontend (JS Injection): Patches the 'app.*.js.gz' file in /www/js/ 
  to inject a draggable, minimizable terminal modal.
• The "Fast-UI" Label: The window header automatically pulls your 
  router's model (e.g., gl-be3600) from the browser's LocalStorage 
  to match a native macOS/Linux terminal feel.

Status + actions (the menu is context-aware - it shows only what applies):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Web Terminal line shows one of:
• NOT INSTALLED - the ttyd package isn't installed.
• DISABLED      - installed, but the terminal is off (the package is kept).
• ENABLED       - on and running.
• SERVICE DOWN  - it's on but the ttyd service died (the terminal won't load).

Actions by state:
• Install and enable - installs the ttyd package, configures it, starts the
  service, and adds the terminal button. (Shown when NOT INSTALLED.)
• Enable  - turns it back on (instant - the package is already there).
• Disable - stops the service and removes the button, but KEEPS the package
  and config, so re-enabling is instant and lossless.
• Reinstall - the fix for SERVICE DOWN: reinstalls the package, restarts the
  service, and re-adds the button. (Shown only when SERVICE DOWN.)
• Uninstall - removes the ttyd package and its config entirely.

Coexists with other Web-UI tweaks:
──────────────────────────────────
The terminal button, the Fan slider range, and the Switch-Position indicator
all paint the same Admin Panel bundle. They share one injection registry, so
enabling or disabling the terminal re-paints the others rather than wiping
them - you no longer need to re-apply Fan settings afterward.

Important UX Notes:
────────────────────
• Auto-refresh: install/disable changes appear the next time you open the admin
  panel - no manual refresh needed. The toolkit re-hashes the bundle (and clears
  the Nginx cache) so the browser fetches the new UI on its own.
• Security: The service is bound to the 'LAN' interface by default. 
  It is not accessible from the WAN (Internet) unless you manually 
  open Port 7681 in the firewall.
• Persistence (reboot): terminal settings are stored in UCI (/etc/config/ttyd),
  so they survive a reboot.
• Enable Persistence (firmware update): a firmware upgrade wipes the Web-UI button.
  Turn on "Enable Persistence" and a small boot service re-applies the button from
  the new firmware's bundle on first boot, reporting the result on the next launch;
  if the new panel changed so the button no longer fits it is left stock and reported
  as unable to restore.

Note: If the icon does not appear after a refresh, ensure "Network
Acceleration" isn't preventing the UI from updating, though the 
script attempts to force this by clearing the Nginx cache.

# ============================================================================
# Shared Web-UI injection registry (glwebui_*)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Several toolkit features paint the SAME admin-panel bundle (/www/js/app.*.js.gz):
# the Web-UI Terminal button, the Fan slider-range patch, and the Switch-Position
# indicator. When each edited that file on its own, a feature's "restore from ROM"
# step silently wiped the others (the old ttyd<->fan collision, patched over with
# one-directional re-injects).
#
# This registry ends the collision. Every install/remove records intent in a small
# PERSISTENT state dir, then rebuilds the bundle from the pristine ROM copy and
# re-applies EVERY still-active injector. So whatever is enabled is always painted
# together and no feature can clobber another.
#
#   state dir:  /etc/glinet_utils/webui/<feature>   (file present = active)
#     ttyd   -> file holds the proto (http|https)
#     fan    -> file holds "MIN MAX CUR" for the validator/setpoint patch
#     switch -> empty marker
#
# Providers (glwebui_prov_*) operate on an UNCOMPRESSED app.js and must be
# idempotent (guard on their own marker). glwebui_rebuild owns the gunzip/gzip,
# the pristine-ROM restore, apply-order and nginx-cache clear.
# ============================================================================

# Web-UI tweak persistence across firmware updates
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A firmware update (sysupgrade) empties the overlay and replaces /www, so the
# three Web-UI overlays (Fan / Web Terminal / Switch indicator) and their
# backends are wiped. When a feature's persistence is ENABLED, we keep the
# registry + a tiny boot service on /etc/sysupgrade.conf; on the first boot
# after /etc/glversion changes, that service calls this toolkit headlessly to
# RE-APPLY the enabled overlays from the NEW firmware's pristine ROM bundle
# (glwebui_rebuild already re-bases from /rom). Re-apply is backend-first and
# FAIL-STOCK per feature: a moved injection anchor leaves the panel stock and
# is reported as a failure - it never corrupts the freshly-flashed bundle.
# The result is shown once on the next toolkit launch (_glpersist_show_report).

# =====================================================================================================
# WHAT SURVIVES A FIRMWARE UPDATE - the persistence model (decided with Vincent 2026-09-29; follow it)
# =====================================================================================================
# A firmware update replaces the whole system; only files on the keep list (sysupgrade -l) come through.
# The goal (Vincent): after the update the PROGRAM and its CONFIG are there and working. Three ways to get it:
#   KEEP WHOLE - the item is self-contained (shell scripts, web files, static programs that link no firmware
#                libraries): its files ride the keep list. Proven safe across every firmware change tested.
#   RE-INSTALL - a package built against the firmware's libraries: its CONFIG rides the keep list and the
#                program is re-installed after the update from the new firmware's feed (glinet_persist). Kept
#                program files broke here: across an apk<->opkg change stress-ng, lscpu, openssl-util and rsync
#                lost libraries and /usr/bin/diff was only an alternatives link (all-on matrix, .3.1). Every
#                re-installed package the feed offered came back working. A service switched off stays off
#                (persist/pkg_services). If the new feed doesn't offer it, the check says so.
#   REBUILD    - toolkit settings: the settings ride the keep list; glinet_persist rebuilds the Web-UI
#                patches and boot services from them.
#
#   Item                   Way         What rides the keep list
#   ---------------------  ----------  -----------------------------------------------------------------
#   Toolkit                keep whole  /usr/sbin/glinet_utils (it's what puts everything else back)
#   OpenSpeedTest          keep whole  /www2 (all of it), its nginx config, its startup script, boot link;
#                                      served by nginx - in GL's image; re-installed after an update if a
#                                      firmware lacks it (_glpersist_ost_restore)
#   AdGuardHome (updated)  keep whole  the program (static - no firmware libraries), startup script, config
#   Bandwidth Limits       keep whole  netlimit config, service script, ifup hook (toolkit-written)
#   SSH Keys               keep whole  /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys
#   Backups                keep whole  /etc/glinet_utils/backups
#   speedtest (Ookla),     keep whole  the program (+ Ookla's licence acceptance) - no feed offers them;
#     speedtest-go                     self-contained, ran across every firmware change tested
#   Fan Control            rebuild     setpoints + static speed (Web-UI patch, boot service rebuilt)
#   Switch Indicator       rebuild     its Web-UI registry entry (Web-UI patch, poller rebuilt)
#   Web Terminal (ttyd)    re-install  /etc/config/ttyd + certificate/key (Web-UI button re-applied)
#   Tailscale              re-install  /etc/config/tailscale + /etc/tailscale (login / node identity)
#   zram-swap              re-install  /etc/config/system (zram settings)
#   LibreSpeed             re-install  /etc/config/librespeed-go (its settings, including on/off)
#   htop / rsync / vim     re-install  htoprc / rsyncd.conf / .vimrc when present
#   stress                 re-install  nothing; the engine follows the kernel (stress <6.6, stress-ng >=6.6)
#   lscpu, apache (htpasswd), openssl-util, diffutils, iperf3, iputils-ping
#                          re-install  nothing (no settings)
# Rule for anything new: self-contained -> keep whole; links firmware libraries -> re-install + keep config.

SSH Key Management – Quick Help

What is an SSH Key?
───────────────────
An SSH key is a "digital passport" that allows you to log into your router
securely without typing your password every time. It consists of a 
Public Key (which stays on the router) and a Private Key (which stays on 
your computer). 

Main Benefits:
• Security: Keys are virtually impossible to brute-force compared to passwords.
• Convenience: Log in instantly from your terminal or script.
• Persistence: This script can ensure your keys survive firmware updates.

How to find or generate your Public Key:
────────────────────────────────────────
Your Public Key usually ends in .pub. DO NOT paste your Private Key.

• macOS / Linux:
  1. Open Terminal.
  2. Check for existing keys: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (or id_ed25519.pub)
  3. To generate new: ssh-keygen -t ed25519
  4. Copy the output of: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

• Windows (PowerShell/CMD):
  1. Open PowerShell.
  2. Check for existing keys: cat $HOME\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
  3. To generate new: ssh-keygen -t ed25519
  4. Copy the text starting with "ssh-ed25519..."

• Windows (PuTTY):
  1. Open 'PuTTYgen'.
  2. Click 'Load' (for existing) or 'Generate' (for new).
  3. Copy the text from the box labeled: 
     "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file"

Usage in this Menu:
───────────────────
1. Add Key: Paste the entire line (starts with ssh-rsa, ssh-ed25519, etc.).
2. Manage: View existing keys. Use [✓] to mark keys for deletion.
3. Persistence: Adds /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys to the
   sysupgrade list so you don't lose access after a firmware update.

Security Warning:
─────────────────
Never share your PRIVATE key with anyone. Only the PUBLIC key belongs
on the router.

Overview
────────
This menu groups configuration and management tools for common GL.iNet
router customizations. Each option targets a specific subsystem.

Options
───────
1. Device Fan Settings
   Adjust fan speed thresholds, min/max RPM, and thermal warning temps.
   Only available on hardware with controllable fans (e.g. Flint 3).

2. Manage Zram Swap
   Install and configure compressed RAM swap. Essential on low-RAM
   devices running AdGuardHome + VPN simultaneously.

3. Web-UI Terminal Interface
   Embed a draggable terminal (powered by ttyd) into the GL.iNet
   Admin Panel as a ">_" icon in the navigation bar.

4. Switch Position Indicator
   Show which way the physical toggle switch is flipped, right on the
   Admin Panel's Toggle Button Settings page (fills the active side
   green). Only on models with a hardware switch.

5. Package and Persistence Manager
   Install useful CLI tools (htop, tcpdump, etc.) and configure them
   to survive firmware upgrades via the sysupgrade keep-list.

6. Package System Repair
   Fix a corrupted package system (the "Missing new line character at
   end of file" opkg error) by rebuilding the feed cache and/or
   repairing the installed database, with backups.

7. Toolkit Management
   Install this script to /usr/sbin/glinet_utils so it can be run
   from anywhere. Manage sysupgrade persistence and updates.

8. Firmware Update
   Update the firmware from GL.iNet's catalogue - the latest build in
   the current channel, another channel, or an older build - showing
   first what the update wouldn't keep.

Web-UI overlays (3 and 4) plus the Fan slider range all paint the same
admin-panel bundle. They share one injection registry, so installing or
removing one never wipes the others.

Moved: the Bandwidth Limiter (now any network, not just guest) and SSH Key
Management now live under Network and VPN Tools on the main menu.

Install to /usr/sbin/glinet_utils
──────────────────────────────────
Copies this script to /usr/sbin/glinet_utils (no .sh extension) so
you can run it from any directory by typing just: glinet_utils

Once installed, the self-updater always targets the installed copy,
keeping a single up-to-date version on your router.

Sysupgrade Persistence
──────────────────────
By default, files added to /usr/sbin via the overlay filesystem are
lost when you perform a firmware upgrade (sysupgrade). Enabling
persistence adds /usr/sbin/glinet_utils to /etc/sysupgrade.conf so
the file is preserved across upgrades.

After a firmware upgrade, the preserved copy will check GitHub for
updates on its first run and self-update if a newer version exists.

View Change Log & Update
────────────────────────
Browse the full change log, newest first. When you are behind, a
line marks your installed version (everything above it is new to
you) and [U] updates in place and restarts. The heading reads
"View Change Log" when you are already up to date. The update checks
free space first and changes nothing if there isn't enough.

Keycap spacing (macOS Terminal only)
────────────────────────────────────
macOS Terminal is the one terminal whose number-keycap spacing can't be
detected, so the choice made at startup is shown here. Change it in
Display Settings.

Uninstall
─────────
Removes /usr/sbin/glinet_utils and its sysupgrade.conf entry.
The script you are currently running is not affected.

# endpoint) - protocol overhead. WireGuard overhead is exact (60 IPv4 / 80 IPv6);
# OpenVPN is a conservative estimate. Everything is derived at runtime from
# `wg show` / `ip` — no interface names or subnets are hardcoded.
# Derive OpenVPN data-channel overhead from the running configuration rather than
# assuming a worst case.  Measured against a live tunnel with tcpdump: UDP +
# AES-256-GCM + tun + peer-id = 52 bytes on IPv4, versus the 69 previously assumed.
#   IPv4 20 + UDP 8 + opcode/peer-id 4 + GCM packet-id 4 + auth tag 16 = 52

VPN Tools - Quick Help

What it does
────────────
A hub for the toolkit's VPN utilities:

  • VPN MTU Optimizer - tune each tunnel's packet size so tunnelled traffic
    stops fragmenting and silently losing throughput.
  • Remote LAN Access - reach the LAN behind the far end of a tunnel (which
    GL.iNet's own "Allow Remote Access to LAN" toggle does not fully set up).

Getting around

Type the number beside an item and press Enter. [0] goes back; [?] shows the
help for whichever screen you are on.

HELPEOF

show_mtu_help() {
    show_paged "VPN MTU Optimizer - Help" << 'HELPEOF'

VPN MTU Optimizer - Quick Help

What it does
────────────
Finds each active WireGuard/OpenVPN tunnel and works out the best MTU - the
largest packet that fits without fragmenting - so tunnelled traffic stops
silently losing throughput.

The status block
────────────────
One tunnel per page; [P]/[N] move between tunnels. For the tunnel on screen:
  • Status       - Active (carrying traffic) or Inactive (down)
  • Current MTU  - what is set now
  • Underlay     - the link the tunnel rides on, and its MTU
  • Overhead     - the protocol's per-packet cost
  • Recommended  - the best MTU (Underlay minus Overhead)
  • Basis        - whether Recommended is Calculated from the link, or Verified
                   by an active probe (with the date and target)

The actions
───────────
Each action applies to the tunnel currently on screen:
  • Optimize Tunnel     - apply the recommended MTU (reads "Recalculate Recommended
                          MTU" when it is already optimal - a fresh re-read of the link)
  • Set MTU Manually    - enter a value by hand
  • Verify with an Active Probe - test the real path and mark the Basis "Verified"
  • Reset MTU           - remove the toolkit's override; the router default
                          governs again (listed only while an override is set)

About Verify (the active probe)
───────────────────────────────
Verify sends don't-fragment test packets to find the largest that survives - but
it can be inconclusive without meaning anything is wrong:
  • A failed ICMP reply does NOT mean the endpoint is down. Many servers (and the
    WireGuard/OpenVPN UDP port itself) simply don't answer ICMP, even while the
    tunnel is up and passing traffic.
  • If something on the path ignores the don't-fragment flag, oversized packets
    get through anyway and the measured size reads too high to trust.
Either way the probe result is discarded and the safe Calculated value is kept.
If the tunnel had a prior Verified value, an inconclusive probe also clears it, so
the Basis returns to Calculated - the path can no longer confirm it. On the result
screen this reads "Verified MTU: unknown" and "Falling back to the Calculated <n>;
this value was not actively verified" - it means "couldn't verify", not "broken".

Notes
─────
  • The value is written where GL.iNet expects it, so it appears in the Admin
    Panel under the tunnel's Options and survives a reboot.

show_rla_help() {
    show_paged "Remote LAN Access - Help" << 'HELPEOF'

Remote LAN Access - Quick Help

What it does
────────────
Lets a device at one end of a VPN reach the LAN behind the other end - which
GL.iNet's "Allow Remote Access to LAN" toggle does not fully route on its own.

The table
─────────
Each row is a traffic flow (outbound or inbound) with its status: whether the
route, the firewall masquerade and per-peer access are in place. Use [P]/[N] to
page between tunnels and directions.

The actions
───────────
Status is measured live on entry and re-checked after any change, so there is no
separate "test" step. The toggles state what pressing them will do right now:
  • Enable / Disable routing to the remote LAN    - outbound.
  • Enable / Disable masquerade                    - outbound; hide your devices
                        behind the tunnel address, or show their real addresses.
  • Enable / Disable inbound access                - let the remote LAN reach you.
  • Detect or set the remote LAN subnet            - refuses one that overlaps
                        your own LAN.

Notes
─────
  • Changes are applied through GL.iNet's own VPN firewall helpers, so they
    persist and stay consistent with the Admin Panel.
  • Inbound access also needs the REMOTE router to route its LAN over the tunnel
    and to not masquerade traffic toward you. That side can only be configured on
    the remote router itself - this tool cannot set it for you.

show_package_help() {
    show_paged "Package & Persistence Manager - Help" << 'HELPEOF'

Package & Persistence Manager - Quick Help

What it does
────────────
Installs the optional tools the toolkit can use (speed tests, benchmarks and
other utilities), and is the one place to choose what survives a firmware
update - packages, and the toolkit's features and settings.

Install / remove
────────────────
  • Toggle a package to mark it for install (or an installed one for removal),
    then Confirm. The right package manager for your firmware (opkg or apk) is
    used automatically.
  • Removals are verified: if a package you are removing is required by other
    installed packages it is kept and reported (you may type YES to force it,
    though that can break the packages that depend on it). A non-package tool
    has all of its files removed, leaving nothing behind.

Size & storage
──────────────
  • Size is the INSTALL size for every package - what it occupies once on disk, not the
    download. Installed rows are measured directly (a firmware-provided package counts too:
    it can be removed from the active partition, returning on a firmware reset); not-installed
    rows are the package index's declared install size, so they are an estimate. "-" means the
    size could not be determined (e.g. a package the index doesn't list).
  • Storage is the free space you'll have if you Confirm - with nothing staged, what's free
    now. On a compressing overlay (ubifs/jffs2) a staged change makes it a conservative "≈"
    floor - real free space is usually a little higher; on f2fs/ext4 it is exact. It turns
    amber when it would get low.
  • Each install checks free space first and is skipped, with the shortfall shown, if
    the package won't fit - so a full overlay never leaves a half-installed package.
  • [S] Sort toggles largest-first (the default) and alphabetical, on both pages.

Pages
─────
Page 1 is Packages, page 2 is Features - [N] Next / [P] Previous
move between them, and only the numbers on the current page are accepted.
[A] All and [Z] None act on the current page only: on Packages, All marks
everything for install + persistence and None for removal; on Features they
switch persistence on or off.

Persistence
───────────
Everything you add survives a reboot. A firmware update is different: it
replaces the system and keeps only what's on the keep list. Persist a package
and it comes back after an update - re-installed once the network is up
("via reinstall"), or, for the few tools no package feed offers, its program
kept as a file. A re-installed package costs only its settings files, so it
barely moves the Persist line. Persistence applies only to installed
packages - uninstalling a tool also clears its persistence.

Features
────────
Page 2 lists the toolkit's own items that an update would otherwise remove:
the toolkit itself, the Web Terminal, fan settings, the switch indicator,
bandwidth limits, OpenSpeedTest, an updated AdGuardHome, SSH keys and backups.
A row shows only while that thing is in use. Toggling one changes the same
setting as its own screen - it isn't a second copy.
The toolkit stays kept while anything else persists: it's what puts them back.

Persist
───────
The Persist line is how much a firmware update carries if you Confirm - with
nothing staged, what it carries now. Opened from Firmware Update, everything the
update would remove comes pre-staged as Enable Persistence, and the Update
Memory meter shows whether the image plus what persists fits in the router's
RAM (the kept files are packed, so they need less than the Persist line).

Notes
─────
  • A package with no build for your CPU (e.g. the Ookla speed test on MIPS) is
    called out up front, with an alternative suggested.
  • Tailscale installs both the daemon and GL's integration (admin-panel toggle,
    kill-switch), and removing it takes both so the full space is freed. It's on
    current firmware; the oldest builds may not offer it.

Package System Repair - Quick Help

What it does
────────────
Detects and fixes the two ways OpenWrt's package system gets corrupted. Both
show up as "parse_from_stream_nomalloc: Missing new line character at end of
file" and make installs and removals fail (or silently do nothing).

What can go wrong
─────────────────
  • Index cache - the downloaded feed lists under /var/opkg-lists. Fully
    re-fetchable, so rebuilding it is safe and loses nothing.
  • Installed database - /usr/lib/opkg/status, the record of what is installed.
    Repaired in place and NEVER deleted; a backup is saved first.

The status block
────────────────
Installed database and Index cache read HEALTHY, CORRUPT or EMPTY. When online,
the check runs a real package-index refresh so the reading is measured, not
guessed; offline it falls back to a structural check of the database.

Actions
───────
  • Item 1 follows the status. When everything reads HEALTHY it is Check for
    Package System Issues - a fresh check that reports what it found. When
    something is CORRUPT or EMPTY it becomes Repair Now - rebuilds the cache first
    (non-destructive); if the database is still unparseable it asks before
    repairing it (backup first).
  • Rebuild the Package Index Cache - forces a fresh download of the feed lists.
  • Repair the Installed Database - backs up, then applies a safe end-of-file
    repair. Deeper damage is left for a backup restore rather than risking the
    file.
  • Backup & Restore the Database - save, restore or delete timestamped copies of
    the installed database, kept under /etc/glinet_utils/backups.

Note: apk-based firmware keeps its own database; there the repair uses apk's own
update and fix.

#                                      Nightly, RC. CLEAN (a plain OpenWrt image without GL.iNet's
#                                      interface) and LEGACY builds are deliberately NOT offered.
#   $FW_API/model/info?model=<m>-open  the OpenWrt-track builds (op24 / op25 in the file name)
# Each build: version, stage, release_time, release_note (HTML), download[] {name, link, sha256, size}.
# Measured 2026-09-26. GL's own web-UI check (the `upgrade` RPC) only offers the next build on the
# router's current track - the catalogue is what lets us offer every channel, and older builds.
# Flashing follows GL's one_click_upgrade step for step (download -> size -> sha256 -> GL signature ->
# not_keep_config parts -> sysupgrade), but each step is shown and its RESULT checked, and we add
# `sysupgrade -T` (OpenWrt's own image + keep-settings compatibility test) and the list of what the

# What persists is packed by the flash into an archive that sits in RAM - its size is MEASURED for real,
# never estimated (Vincent 2026-10-03): the same `tar -czf` of the same file list that `sysupgrade -b`
# runs, streamed into a byte count (byte-identical to `sysupgrade -b` - 43,940,119 B both ways on .3.1 -
# and nothing held in RAM). Not `sysupgrade -b` itself: it shares /tmp/sysupgrade.conffiles with
# `sysupgrade -l`, which deletes it on exit, so any -l (the toolkit runs several) breaks a -b in flight.
# It's slow (21 s for 67 MB on an MT3000 - it compresses), so each result is remembered against a
# fingerprint of what persists (every kept file's path, size and time; 0.5 s), and it starts in the
# background when Firmware Update opens / redraws or what persists changes - usually done before the
# Package Manager or the flash flow needs it; they wait only for the rest. Session files, removed on exit.

Firmware Update - Quick Help

What it does
────────────
Updates the router's firmware from GL.iNet's own download catalogue - the
latest build in the current channel, another channel, or an older build
(a downgrade) - with the same safety checks GL.iNet's web interface uses,
plus a few more.

The status block
────────────────
  • Channel - the firmware track the router is on: STABLE, BETA, NIGHTLY,
    RC, OPENWRT 25 or OPENWRT 24. Version and Update belong to it.
  • Update - UP TO DATE, AVAILABLE (with the build), or UNKNOWN when GL.iNet's
    server can't be reached.
  • Not Persisted - what an update would remove, measured from the router's
    own keep list: the toolkit, its features and settings (Web Terminal, fan,
    switch indicator, limits, OpenSpeedTest, AdGuardHome, SSH keys, backups)
    and Package Manager packages that aren't set to persist - including ones
    the current firmware came with, since the next firmware may not. GL.iNet's
    own add-ons, and helpers the toolkit re-installs by itself, aren't listed.
  • Last Update - the result of the most recent update attempt.

Actions
───────
  • Update to <build> / Check for Updates - the newest build in the current
    channel, or a fresh check when there's nothing newer.
  • Choose a Build - every build GL.iNet offers this router in one list,
    grouped by channel (newest first, up to 10 each). The installed build starts
    selected; [#] picks another (an older one is a downgrade) and [R] shows the
    selected build's release notes. Picking the installed build again makes it
    Reinstall - a re-flash of the same build, for a damaged firmware partition.
  • Manage Persistence - the Package & Persistence Manager, with everything
    an update would remove staged to persist, and the Update Memory meter.
  • View Update History - every update attempt, newest first: what was
    true before it, each check and its result, and what came back after.

How an update runs
──────────────────
Keep settings is the default; not keeping them wipes the router back to
first-time setup and asks a second time. Then, each step checked before the
next. First what the update would remove, with the choice to persist it (the
Package & Persistence Manager, pre-staged). Then memory: the image and the
persisted files both sit in RAM during the flash, and running services count
against it - the Update Memory meter shows the fit. Amber cells mean it's
close, which is still fine (measured on real flashes). When it says "won't
fit", it offers to stop services such as Tailscale or AdGuardHome (they start
again with the reboot, or straight away if the update doesn't happen); if it
still won't fit, the update is stopped. Then the download, GL.iNet's checksum,
GL.iNet's signature, and OpenWrt's own image test (right board; settings compatible).
Only then does it say what happens next and ask to flash, followed by a
10-second countdown (Enter starts now, any other key cancels). The router reboots and is unreachable for
about 5 minutes - keep the power on. In the Web-UI Terminal it warns first:
the terminal disconnects too, and only returns if ttyd persists.

After the update
────────────────
The next time the toolkit starts it checks the update against what was true
before it: the firmware, SSH keys, AdGuardHome, bandwidth limits, zram swap,
the fan, packages on the re-install list (and why one didn't come back),
programs kept as files (they must still run) and Web-UI tweaks. Last Update
shows the result - OK, ISSUES (something didn't come back), PENDING (still
coming back; checked again later) or FAILED. The toolkit itself must survive
the update to do this - it's the first row offered to keep. Details are in View
Update History.

Not offered: CLEAN (a plain OpenWrt image without GL.iNet's interface) and
LEGACY builds - use GL.iNet's Download Center for those.

System Benchmarks – Quick Help

Overview
────────
This menu provides a suite of tools to validate hardware performance, thermal 
stability, and network throughput. These tests help identify if your router 
is throttling due to heat or if your storage/RAM is underperforming.

Benchmark Categories:
─────────────────────
• CPU & Thermal: Options 1 and 2 test the processor. The Stress Test pushes
  all cores/threads to 100% to test heat soak, while the VPN & Crypto Benchmark ranks
  this device against saved routers for WireGuard, OpenVPN and RSA throughput.
• Storage & Memory: Options 3 and 4 measure I/O speeds. Use these to test 
  the performance of the internal NAND vs. attached USB 3.0 drives or to 
  check if RAM bandwidth is saturated.
• Connectivity: Options 5 and 6 measure latency and external WAN speeds. 
  Essential for troubleshooting "slow internet" vs. "slow DNS." Option 6 (Ookla)
  runs on every router - on MIPS, where Ookla ships no binary, it uses speedtest-go
  against the same speedtest.net servers. Before downloading, it checks free space;
  if flash is short it offers to run from RAM for this session instead.
• Local Servers: Options 7, 8, and 9 turn the router into a speedtest target. 
  These are used to test Wi-Fi/LAN limits without ISP interference.

Technical Details:
──────────────────
• Stress Testing: One 'stress' tool whose engine follows the kernel: the
  'stress' package below kernel 6.6, stress-ng from 6.6 (stress-ng can hard-crash
  older kernels, so it's never used there). A firmware update that crosses 6.6
  switches the engine when the tool is re-installed.
• Baselines: The VPN & Crypto Benchmark is a leaderboard - its "vs yours"
  column compares saved devices to the one you are on. Disk and Memory tests
  use a fixed Beryl 7 (0.0%) reference point.
• Timing: Disk and Memory tests use /proc/uptime millisecond offsets for 
  precise Speed (MB/s) calculations rather than relying on 'dd' output.

Note on Local Servers:
──────────────────────
iPerf3 is the industry standard for CLI testing. LibreSpeed and OpenSpeedTest 
provide a browser-based UI for testing from phones and tablets without apps.

LibreSpeed Speed Test Server – Quick Help

What is LibreSpeed?
───────────────────
LibreSpeed is a lightweight, open-source speed test server written in Go. Unlike 
traditional speed tests that rely on external servers, this runs locally on your 
router. This allows you to test the actual throughput of your LAN and Wi-Fi 
without being limited by your ISP's internet speed.

Main features on GL.iNet routers:
• Zero Dependencies: Standalone Go binary; does not require Nginx or PHP.
• Lightweight: Extremely low CPU and RAM footprint, ideal for travel routers.
• Privacy Focused: No telemetry, no ads, and no data collection.
• Local Benchmarking: Perfect for testing Wi-Fi 6/7 performance and signal dead zones.

LibreSpeed vs. OpenSpeedTest:
─────────────────────────────
• LibreSpeed: Best for background monitoring and 1Gbps wireless audits. 
  It is much lighter on system resources (RAM/CPU).
• OpenSpeedTest: Better for high-stress 2.5G/10G throughput testing on 
  powerful hardware (like the Flint 2/3) due to its multi-threaded nature.
• Better Together: Both can run simultaneously on different ports (e.g., 8989 
  and 8888) to allow A/B testing of your wireless environment.

When should you use it?
Yes → To find Wi-Fi dead zones or verify the max speed of your local network.
Yes → To check if your VPN or SQM settings are bottlenecking your local speeds.
No  → If you only care about your ISP's "Internet" speed (use Ookla for that).

Important notes:
• Listen Port: Defaults to :8989. Access via http://<router-ip>:8989
• Procd Jail: Runs in a secure sandbox for improved router security.

Status + actions (the menu is context-aware - it shows only what applies):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Service line shows one of:
• NOT INSTALLED - the librespeed-go package isn't installed.
• DISABLED      - installed, but the service is off (the package is kept).
• ENABLED       - on and listening on port 8989.
• SERVICE DOWN  - it's enabled but nothing is listening (it didn't start).

Actions by state:
• Install and enable - installs the librespeed-go package, configures it, and starts
  the service. (Shown when NOT INSTALLED.)
• Enable  - turns it back on (instant - the package is already there).
• Disable - stops the service but KEEPS the package and config, so re-enabling is
  instant and lossless.
• Reinstall - the fix for SERVICE DOWN: reinstalls the package and restarts it.
  (Shown only when SERVICE DOWN.)
• Uninstall - removes the librespeed-go package and its persistence entries entirely.
• Enable/Disable Persistence - keep the binary and settings across firmware updates
  (adds them to the sysupgrade backup). Available once it is enabled.

# ============================ System Configuration Viewer ============================
# Read-only, curated views of the router's UCI config. Each _uci_view_* emitter writes
# plain content lines to stdout (no header/clear/press_any_key); _uci_page adds the
# shared paged viewer (show_paged) so long output no longer scrolls off, plus a safety-
# net mask for WireGuard/OpenVPN-style base64 keys. Wi-Fi PSKs are shown deliberately
# (admin convenience); cryptographic keys are never printed raw.

# Page one category: emitter body arrives on stdin; mask 44-char base64 keys; then page.

System Configuration Viewer - Quick Help

Read-only, curated views of the router's live UCI configuration - nothing here
changes anything. Each screen pages so long output never scrolls off: [N]/[P]
to move between pages, [0] to go back.

The screens
───────────
  1 Wireless   2 Network   3 Firewall   4 VPN   5 System   6 Cloud

Network now covers every interface, DHCP pools + static leases, routes and DNS;
Firewall shows the default policy, zones, forwardings, port forwards and rules;
VPN adds Tailscale and ZeroTier when present.

Wi-Fi passwords are shown (you own the router); VPN private keys and other
cryptographic secrets are never displayed.

OpenSpeedTest Server - Quick Help

What it does
────────────
Hosts the OpenSpeedTest web app on this router so you can test LAN/Wi-Fi speed
between a device and the router from any browser - no internet needed, no app.
It runs its own nginx instance on port 8888 (separate from the admin panel).

Status + actions (the menu is context-aware - it shows only what applies)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Service line shows one of:
• NOT INSTALLED - the web app isn't installed.
• DISABLED      - installed, but the service is off (the app files are kept).
• ENABLED       - on and serving on port 8888.
• SERVICE DOWN  - it's enabled but nginx isn't running (the page won't load).

Actions by state:
  • Install and enable: installs any missing dependencies (nginx, unzip, wget),
    downloads the web app from your chosen source (offering a mounted external
    drive if the internal flash is short), writes the nginx config + service, and
    starts it. (Shown when NOT INSTALLED.)
  • Enable: starts the service again with no re-download (the app files are kept).
  • Disable: stops the service but KEEPS the app files, so re-enabling is instant.
  • Reinstall: the fix for SERVICE DOWN - re-downloads the app, rewrites the config
    and service, and restarts. (Shown only when SERVICE DOWN.)
  • Uninstall: stops the service and removes the app, config, and service script.
  • Diagnostics: reports whether the service is running and the port is listening,
    and shows the URL to open.
  • Enable/Disable Persistence: keep OpenSpeedTest across a firmware upgrade (adds
    its files to the sysupgrade backup). Off by default to save space.

Space needed
────────────
The install screen's "N MB free, ~40 MB required" is the FLASH cost - the
extracted app is ~31MB and lands in /www2 (permanent storage). Both sources
share that cost. The two sources differ in HOW they download:
  • Official (github.com/openspeedtest): a tarball STREAMED straight to flash -
    nothing is staged, so it needs no temp space. Lightest footprint.
  • GL.iNet mirror (for regions where GitHub is blocked): a zip that can't be
    streamed, so it is first staged in /tmp (RAM) before unpacking - hence the
    extra "+32 MB temp" on that line. That RAM is freed once install finishes.
Both pools are checked precisely after you choose; if flash is short you can
point /www2 at a mounted drive, and if /tmp is short pick the Official source.

Using it
────────
Open http://<router-LAN-IP>:8888 in a browser on the same network, then press
Start. For an accurate result use a wired or 5/6GHz client - the test measures
the path between your device and the router.

GL.iNet Toolkit - Quick Help

What it does
────────────
The top-level menu of the GL.iNet router toolkit. Each entry opens a dedicated
area of the toolkit:

• Hardware Information      – read-only system, CPU, memory and thermal details
• AdGuardHome Control Center – DNS filtering, backups and service control
• System Tweaks             – hardware, network, package and toolkit settings
• System Benchmarks         – CPU, memory, disk and network speed tests
• System Configuration      – read-only view of the router's UCI config

Getting around (the same keys work on every screen):
• Type the number shown beside an item and press Enter to open it.
• [0] leaves the current screen — here it exits the toolkit; on inner screens
  it goes Back, or returns to the Main Menu.
• [?] shows the help for whichever screen you are on.
